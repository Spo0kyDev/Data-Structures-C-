# 🧬 Data Structures in C++

This repository is a look into the structures beneath the surface — lists, trees, maps, and memory.  
It's not meant to be flashy. It's a place to work through ideas, document the logic, and leave behind a clear trail.

Everything here is built from scratch in C++, piece by piece — as both study and statement.

## 🎯 Project Goals

This repo is about clarity — understanding how data is stored, accessed, and shaped in memory.

- Practice writing clean, self-contained C++ code  
- Reinforce computer science foundations (with testable proof)  
- Build a long-term reference that I control and understand  
- Leave behind something others can trace, if they choose to follow

## 📦 Structures To Be Implemented

These are the structures I’ve chosen to build from the ground up — not to check a box, but to understand their mechanics without abstraction.  
There’s a difference between knowing something works and knowing *why*.

### 🔹 Core Foundations
- [ ] Array Operations
- [ ] Recursion (Call Stack Visualization)
- [ ] Algorithm Analysis (Big-O / Complexity Notes)

### 🔹 Linear Structures
- [ ] Array-Based Stack
- [ ] Array-Based Queue
- [ ] Postfix Notation / Balanced Parentheses Parser
- [ ] Linked List (Singly)
- [ ] Doubly Linked List

### 🔹 Priority & Sorting
- [ ] Array-Based Priority Queue
- [ ] Quicksort
- [ ] Heapsort
- [ ] Min Heap / Max Heap

### 🔹 Hashing
- [ ] Hash Table (with Linear/Quadratic Probing)
- [ ] Hash Function Analysis

### 🔹 Trees & Beyond
- [ ] Binary Search Tree (BST)
- [ ] Tree Traversals (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder)
- [ ] AVL Tree (if time allows)
- [ ] Graph (Adjacency List)

> These structures are implemented not just to function, but to be understood. No STL containers, no libraries — only raw C++ and memory.

## 🛠️ Code Style & Documentation

This codebase follows a simple rule: write for the person who comes after — even if that person is just you, six months from now.

- Doxygen-style comments will be used throughout all source files  
- Code is written with clarity in mind — minimal abstraction, maximum readability  
- Variable and function names are chosen with intention — the code should tell the story without needing a decoder

Self-documenting code is the goal. Comments exist not to explain *what* the code is doing, but *why* it’s doing it.

> I don’t write code to impress the compiler — I write it so I can read it later and know I wasn’t lying to myself.  
> I’m not here to obfuscate. I’m here to observe, implement, and understand.
