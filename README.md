# Data Structures in C++

This repository is a look into the structures beneath the surface — lists, trees, maps, and memory.  
It's not meant to be flashy. It's a place to work through ideas, document the logic, and leave behind a clear trail.

Everything here is built from scratch in C++, piece by piece — as both study and statement.

## Project Goals

This repo is about clarity — understanding how data is stored, accessed, and shaped in memory.

- Practice writing clean, self-contained C++ code  
- Reinforce computer science foundations (with testable proof)  
- Build a long-term reference that I control and understand  
- Leave behind something others can trace, if they choose to follow
