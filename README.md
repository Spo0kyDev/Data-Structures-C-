# Data Stuctures in C++

This repository is a quiet investigation into the structures beneath the surface â€” lists, trees, maps, and memory. It's not meant to be flashy. It's a place to work through ideas, document the logic, and leave behind a clear trail.

Everything here is built from scratch in C++, piece by piece, as both study and statement.
